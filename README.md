# Retainly
Retainly is spaced based repeition learning done right. Traditional spaced based repeition applications fail in one of two ways
1) They implement learning algorithms that are gated behind [paywalls](https://www.quizlet.com)
2) They have ugly [user interfaces](https://www.ankiweb.net) 

Retainly sets out to fix this by implementing a [simple yet effective approach](https://ncase.me/remember). 

Usage is clearly descirbed in the help printout and the commands are simple
- list: lists all of the cards in the deck
- add: add a new card to the deck
- modify: modify a card in the deck
- delete: delete a card from the deck
- start: start the learning for the day
- batch: utilize gpt to batch add cards. Extremely useful when you create a ton of cards to add but dont want to add them manually. Have to add in api key if you wish to use this
