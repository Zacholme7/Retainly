What is the idea behind all of this?
-------------------------------------
- have a client, a server, and common
- want something that will implement spaced reptition for flashcards
  - https://ncase.me/remember/
- what are all of the functions
client
- will run on the host machine
- ill start this out just as a command line thing then move it to a tui eventually
- it will communicate with some server that will contain all the cards and logic for the spaced repetition learning
- the client should have the functionality to add a card, delete a card, modify a card, and try to answer prompts correctly
  - maybe something with card groups/directory structure in a way
- client api...

server
- this will run on an aws server
- the idea behind this is to implement all of the server logic that we need to run the app
- it should communicate with a database that stores all of the card
- it should have the logic for sending which cards need to be reviewed to the client

common
- this is just for common functionality that is going to be used by both the client and the server
- card definitions, errors, etc


- need some way to interact with cards via a id, rather than their name


Api design???
client:
- add_card(term: String, def: String)
  - adds a card to our list of cards
  - will construct the card and then send it over to the webserver
- remove_card(term: String)
  - removes a card from the list of cards
  - will send a message to the webserver with the term we want to remove


server:
- add_card_to_database()..
  - will recieve the message from the client, extract the info, and then add a card to the database
