# Retainly
Retainly is spaced based repeition learning done right. Traditional spaced based repeition applications fail in one of two ways
1) They implement learning algorithms that are gated behind [paywalls](www.quizlet.com)
2) They have ugly [user interfaces](www.ankiweb.net) with limited configuration

Retainly sets out to fix this by implementing a [simple yet effective approach](https://ncase.me/remember). 

# Usage 
1. Put the server on some hosting platform such as aws
2. Configure URL to be able to connect from client
3. Run the client on host device or ssh into cloud instance for daily learning

The commands are simple
- list: lists all of the cards in the deck
- add: add a new card to the deck
- modify: modify a card in the deck
- delete: delete a card from the deck
- start: start the learning for the day


# Future additions
- Full deck configuration
- Cool Terminal user interface
